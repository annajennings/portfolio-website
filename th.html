          <h1>TotalHealth</h1>
              <p>For my project as part of the CareerFoundry UX Design Immersion course, I chose to design a health app that allows users to centralize all of their health data and medical records in one application available on desktop and mobile.</p>

            <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>Many health popular and effective health apps already exist, but it is difficult to tailor one app to suit everyoneâ€™s needs. My challenge was to design a responsive web app that syncs other apps, collects data and metrics,  and stores medical records for a user on one platform.</p>
            <h3> PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>Actively managing one's health often requires using several apps for different aspects of health. Users need a way to centralize all data and records in one place to improve and streamline their healthcare.</p>
            <h3> HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>I believe an app that allows users to sync their favorite health apps they already use, track upcoming appointments, and organize all of their medical records in one application would streamline and improve the user's health management.</p>
            <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
            <p>As the sole UX designer, I applied the Design Thinking method in the following steps, which I will detail below in this case study:</p>
            <h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
            <p>Understand and observe existing health apps with Competitive Analysis & User Interviews</p>
            <h3>CONCEPTUALIZATION</h3>
            <p>Create a User Personas to better understand problem to be solved then create User Flows from this POV.</p>
            <h3>ITERATION</h3>
            <p>Transform user flows into wireframes then high-fidelity clickable prototype to conduct user testing and further refine design</p>
            <h3>EXPOSITION</h3>
            <p>Tell story of the design process, methodology, and evidence to support design decision in presentation</p>

            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
                <h3>COMPETITIVE ANLAYSIS & USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
                <p>My first step of the design process was conducting a Competitive Analysis to understand what resources already exist in popular health apps.</p>
                <p>View my <a href="files\th\th-competitive-analysis.pdf">Competitive analysis</a></p>
                <p>The results were very valuable and showed that there are many highly-rated, direct competitors, including: Fabulous, Recovery Record, Weight Watchers, Noom, Apple Health, Solstice Health, among many others. However, while each app had its merits, I couldn't find a product available that gives options for customization while maintaining simplicity.</p>
                <p>After the competitive analysis, I conducted User Interviews and Surveys. My goals for the user interviews were to collect qualitative (interviews) and quantitative data (surveys) to understand which apps and features are most popular, gauge interest in an all-in-one health application, and pinpoint the common pain points.</p>
                <p>View my detailed <a href="files\th\th-user-test-plan.pdf">USER TEST PLAN & SCRIPT</a></p>
                <p>After collecting all results, I reviewed and dissected the recordings of these interviews to pull relevant bits of information. I then transferred those to individual post-it notes and created an affinity map to visual the results:</p>

                <p>Affinity map #2, organized by types of feelings/dtatements</p>
                <p>These affinity maps led me to many valuable insights, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Opinions on Existing Apps: Users base their opinions of apps on interface, accuracy, and details of metrics</li>
                  <li> Apps & Devices: Most users of health apps use more than one. Apple Health and My Fitness Pal are among the most popular</li>
                  <li>Feelings: There is a general ambivalence, leaning towards the positive side, about experiences with  health apps</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>CONECPTUALIZATION</h2>
                <h3>USER PERSONAS & USER FLOWS</h3>
                <p>The inspiration phase helped me identify my target user as someone who is between the ages of 18 and 65 with an active interest in managing their health. This and the other discoveries I made in the inspiration phase led to creating two user personas:</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img\th\img-persona1@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="img\th\img-persona1@2x.jpg" alt="User persona #1">
                </picture>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img\th\img-persona2@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="img\th\img-persona2@2x.jpg" alt="User persona #2">
                </picture>
                <p>With such a wide audience and large scope, I was having difficulty defining the Problem and Hypothesis Statements. The user personas helped, but I was still struggling with understanding which features would be most useful to the user while not including so many that the app becomes cluttered and confusing.</p>
                <p>This proved to be a continuing challenge, but I knew I could always go back to revise my goals, so I pushed forward with these working statements:</p>
                <h4> PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
                <p>Actively managing one's health often requires using several apps for different aspects of health. Users need a way to centralize all data and records in one place to improve and streamline their healthcare.</p>
                <h4> HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT</h4>
                <p>I believe an app that allows users to sync their favorite health apps they already use, track upcoming appointments, and organize all of their medical records in one application would streamline and improve the user's health management.</p>
                <p>After establishing a working understanding of the problem to be solved and the users who would benefit from a solution, I identified a handful of tasks to help me focus on the most important features and created user journeys to imagine the emotional journey a user might experience.</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img\th\img-journey@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="img\th\img-journey@2x.jpg" alt="User journey">
                </picture>
                <p>This gave me insight to a few features that would improve the user experience, including a tool that allows users to view their progress and upload records by taking a photo on their phone.</p>
                <p>These discoveries were valuable in the conceptualization phase, leading to more detailed user flows:</p>

        <div>
            <h2>ITERATION</h2>
                  <h3>WIREFRAMES & PROTOTYPES</h3>
                  <p>With a the conceptual phase done, I began iterating possible solutions, starting with a site-map:</p>
                  <picture>
                      <source srcset="img\th\img-sitemap@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
                      <img src="img\th\img-sitemap@2x.jpg" alt="User flow">
                  </picture>
                  <p>To reduce the cognitive load for users, I structured the website hierarchy into four main categories--Account, My Data, My Calendar, and My Records-- so the user only needs to choose from a few options on each screen.</p>
                  <p>The results of a <a href="files\th\th-card-sort">CARD SORT</a>card sort I conducted with Optimal Workshop mostly confirmed my instincts organizing the app features into the highest-level categories, which was a relief as I created my low-fidelity wireframes. </p>
                  <p>I began with wireframing three user flows each for desktop and mobile, then laying them out to produce low-fidelity prototypes:</p>
                  <picture>
                      <source srcset="img\th\img-lowfi-wireframes@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                  </picture>
                  <p>In sketching out my wireframes, I faced that same challenge deciding which features to focus on while maintaining simplicity to avoid overwhelming users. However, things were slowly becoming clearer and I decided to focus on the most important tasks: adding new appointments, syncing with other apps/devices, uploading and sharing records,  and viewing the progress chart. I had to put a few of my ideas, such as building a learning feature, on the back-burner for later iterations.</p>
                  <p>I continued onto mid-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, making adjustments at each level to clarify the user experience. Then, finally, I had my high-fidelity prototype ready for user testing!</p>

                  <h3>USER TESTING</h3>
                  <p>I chose moderated remote and in-person testing methods to balance the ease of scheduling with remote participants and the advantage of being physically present to observe participants in-person.</p>
                  <p>â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹At the beginning of each session, I explained the project, purpose, and intended use of information and confirmed that participants had all their questions answered. View my <a href="files\th\th-user-test-plan-script"User Test Plan & Script.</p>
                  <p>RESULTS:<a href="files\th\th-usability-test-report">Usability test report</a></p>
                  <p>The usability tests provided valuable results for my design process. The participants helped me make design decisions, but most importantly, I discovered I overlooked some major components to the navigation and user experience.</p>
                  <p>One of the more severe problems was the lack of confirmation after most of the tasks on both mobile and desktop. Users were unsure after completing tasks if they were successful, making them less comfortable using the app. </p>
                  <p>I did have one confirmation box in the desktop prototype after adding a new appointment, but discovered the dialog box slowed the user in moving between tasks. To reduce to impact of the confirmation while making sure the user is reassured, I transformed the confirmation into a snackbar instead. </p>

                  <p>Updated confirmation feedback</p>
                  <p>This worked better because it returned the user to the screen they initiated the task on immediately, allowing them to continue onto their next task smoothly while still providing a subtle confirmation.</p>

            <h2>EXPOSITION</h2>
                    <h3>TELL STORY & PRESENT</h3>
                    <p>With the user experience design mostly complete, I turned my attention to the user interface design and creating a design language system for TotalHealth.</p>
                    <p>I established a color palette with cool greens and blues, which have a calming and trustworthy effect on users.</p>
                    <picture>
                      <source srcset="img\th\img-color-palette@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                    </picture>
                    <p>Additionally, I made a final decision on font which was difficult. I wanted a font that was pleasant and calming, but very easily readable with just a hint of style. So, I went with one of my favorites, Century Gothic. </p>
                    <picture>
                      <source srcset="img\th\img-typography@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                    </picture>
                    <p>At this point, I realized that using illustrations as visuals instead of photo would be better because they are easier to coordinate with the color palette. Also, they're fun! But not distracting... </p>
                    <p>New splash screens for both desktop and mobile:</p>

                    <p>Desktop splash screen</p>
                    <p>It was very satisfying and exciting to see my design come to life visually with the addition of UI elements. After solidifying the designs for mobile and desktop--differentiating the use of color slightly while maintaining cohesion across devices--I created the full <a href="files\th\th-design-language-system">Design Language System </a> document,  then moved onto preparing to present and package up my deliverables and assets for handoff:</p>
                    <p><a href="files\th\th-deliverables-assets">TOTALHEALTH DESIGN DELIVERABLES AND ASSESTS FOLDER</a></p>
                    <p>One last step before presentation: soliciting feedback! I reached out to colleagues for a bit of feedback on my design. I received a lot of valuable insights from my fellow designers, plenty of encouragement. </p>
                    <p>One observation was that my original home screen was a bit redundant with the tabs. So, I removed the tabs from the home screen only, and added a side bar menu for an alternate method of navigation that's tucked away unless the user clicks on it. </p>

                    <p>Desktop home page with side menu</p>
                    <p>Another colleague pointed out that I had a search bar in the top navigation bar, but it was unclear what could be searched for and why it was on every screen. This is a perfect example of the power of another set of eyes on a design before finishing--I hadn't even thought about this!</p>
                    <p>I originally intended the search to allow users to find records more quickly, so I deleted it from the top bar and replaced it with the heart from the logo. Then, I put a search field on only the Records screen instead. </p>
